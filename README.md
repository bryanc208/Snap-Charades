Project created for Kik Hackathon by [Bryan Cho](linkedin.com/in/bryancho), [Tanatorn Nantawinyoo](https://www.linkedin.com/profile/view?trk=contacts-contacts-list-contact_name-0&id=371446314), [Josh Lee](https://www.linkedin.com/profile/view?trk=contacts-contacts-list-contact_name-0&id=398694306), and [David Choi](https://www.linkedin.com/profile/view?trk=contacts-contacts-list-contact_name-0&id=395099926).

Source code for Android app that we made collaboratively at Kik Hackathon, Waterloo, ON. 

The app allows users to take a selfie according to a "prompt" and then send them to any user in our database. For now, the backend is implemented using Parse.com. 

We have numerous ideas of where this project can go and we'd love to see it grow into a full fledged app. 

Thanks for your interest and support! We will update soon when we post the app to the Play Store.

Stay tuned.
